# Human Interface Guidelines

These guidelines are designed to help developers and designers create a beautifully consistent experience on the elementary OS desktop. They were written for interface designers, graphic artists and software developers who will be working on elementary OS. They will not only define specific design elements and principles, but will also instill a philosophy that will help you decide when it is appropriate to deviate from the Guidelines. Adhering to the suggestions contained here will provide many benefits:

* Users will **learn to use your app faster**, because it shares common elements that they are already familiar with.
* Users will **accomplish tasks more quickly**, because you will have a straight-forward interface design that isn't confusing or difficult.
* Your app will appear **native to the desktop**, and share the same elegant look as default applications.
* Your app will be **easier to document**, because an expected behavior does not require explanation.
* The **amount of support you will have to provide will decrease**—including the number of issues filed—for the reasons above.

To help you achieve these goals, these guidelines will cover basic interface elements, how to use them and put them together effectively, and how to make your app integrate well with the desktop. The most important thing to remember is that following these guidelines will make it easier to design a new app, not harder.

Keep in mind that this is a set of guidelines, not a rule book. New, amazing interaction paradigms appear every day and more are waiting to be discovered. This is a living document that can and will be changed.
